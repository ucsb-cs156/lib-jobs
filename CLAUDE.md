# lib-jobs

Shared async jobs system (Maven Spring Boot starter + npm components package)
for the ucsb-cs156 course projects. Extracted from the homegrown jobs system
duplicated across proj-courses, proj-frontiers, proj-scaffold, proj-happycows;
to be installed fresh into proj-dining.

## Read this first

**`docs/DESIGN.md` is the source of truth** for the architecture, the drift
survey of the five app repos, all design decisions (User decoupling via
`JobUserProvider`, job scoping via `scopeType`/`scopeId` columns generalizing
frontiers' `Course` link, auto-configuration contents), the publishing setup
(JitPack for Maven, npmjs for `@ucsb-cs156/jobs-components`), the phased
rollout plan, and the resolved §7 decisions (all settled with Phill
2026-07-12). Do not re-derive any of that; start from the doc and update it
when decisions change.

## Current status

- [x] Phase 0: design reviewed; all §7 questions resolved with Phill 2026-07-12
      (headline: frontiers' Course link generalizes into library `scopeType`/`scopeId`
      columns, DESIGN.md §3.4; MIT license; Phill creating the npm org)
- [x] Phase 1: backend library built and released 2026-07-12 — 45 tests, jacoco
      100%, pitest 100% (autoconfig excluded), org CI workflows green, gh-pages
      docs live, tagged v0.1.0, JitPack build verified
      (`com.github.ucsb-cs156:lib-jobs:v0.1.0` resolves)
- [x] Phase 2: installation pilot in proj-dining (backend) — done 2026-07-12.
      PR ucsb-cs156/proj-dining#131; adoption = JitPack dep + one Liquibase
      include + JobUserProviderImpl + TestJob/launch endpoint; dining gates
      stayed at jacoco 100% / pitest 100%; smoke-tested on dokku (Postgres)
      incl. Liquibase-from-jar and both complete/error paths. Lesson captured
      in v0.1.1: library bean names must be namespaced (libJobs*) since apps
      keep a launch controller whose bean name is jobsController.
- [x] Phase 3: migration pilot in proj-scaffold — merged 2026-07-13, PR
      ucsb-cs156/proj-scaffold#86 (backend 744 tests / jacoco 100% / pitest
      1039/1039, frontend 646 tests / prettier / eslint). Deleted core +
      AsyncConfig; scaffold turned out to have frontiers' FULL Course coupling,
      so it also piloted the course→scope migration (changeset 039) originally
      planned for phase 6.

      Two real bugs found via dokku smoke-testing after #86 merged, each fixed
      as a lib-jobs point release and landed via follow-up PR
      ucsb-cs156/proj-scaffold#88 (merged 2026-07-13; both fixes verified live
      on dokku before merge):
      - **v0.1.4**: job body runs in one all-or-nothing transaction, so log
        writes joined it and were invisible until the job finished — a
        multi-minute job (SyncCourseWithPlRepoJob working through GitHub API
        retries) looked hung. Fixed with a REQUIRES_NEW transaction per log
        line; jobs also now start `queued` and only report `running` once the
        executor picks them up. Verified with an integration test that reads
        the log from another connection mid-run.
      - **v0.1.5**: v0.1.4 itself shipped a regression — swagger-annotations-
        jakarta was a plain compile dependency, so its pinned 2.2.28 won
        Maven's nearest-wins mediation over springdoc's own (newer, deeper)
        transitive version, breaking OpenAPI doc generation app-wide
        (NoSuchMethodError on `Parameter.validationGroups()`; Swagger UI
        failed to load). Fixed by marking it `provided`. A same-reactor
        runtime test to guard this is structurally impossible (`provided`
        doesn't stop the conflict from recreating itself inside lib-jobs's
        own build); guarded instead with `PomDependencyScopeTests`, which
        pins the pom.xml scope declaration directly.

      Lesson for phases 4-6: budget for a live smoke test after each merge,
      not just green CI — scaffold has no integration/web-IT workflow, so
      neither regression would have been caught by CI alone.
- [ ] Phases 4–6: proj-courses, proj-happycows, proj-frontiers (frontiers last — scope migration)
- [ ] Phase 7: frontend package in `frontend/`

Update the checklist above as phases complete.

## Conventions

- Mirror the org's app-repo conventions: Spring Boot 3.x, google-java-format
  via git-code-format-maven-plugin (the shared format workflow requires that
  plugin, not spotless), jacoco 100% + pitest gates, prettier/eslint on
  frontend.
- CI = thin callers into `ucsb-cs156/workflows@main` (same numbering as the
  app repos); gh-pages docs site built from `frontend/docs-index/` (workflow
  04 hardcodes that path — do not move it to the repo root). Tests run against
  the shipped Liquibase changelog (`db/migration/lib-jobs/`) with
  `ddl-auto=validate`, so entity/changelog drift fails `mvn test`.
- Reference implementations to compare against live in the sibling checkouts,
  e.g. `~/github/ucsb-cs156/proj-courses` (and the other app repos on GitHub
  under ucsb-cs156). The most evolved backend core to seed from is
  proj-frontiers' `services/jobs/` (see DESIGN.md Appendix A).
- JitPack requires the Maven build at the repo root; keep `frontend/` for npm.
- Releases: tag `vX.Y.Z`; JitPack builds Maven on demand; GitHub Actions
  publishes npm on tag.
